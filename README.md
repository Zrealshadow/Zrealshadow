## Hi There
I'm a graduated student from Beijing Institude Technology. 

I used to study at BIT DB Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Meihui Zhang](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/zmh/index.htm) , and do some research on knowledge graph.

(I extremely appreciate my professor's help on me. QAQ)

I received the admission from Computer science and engineering Department in Tufts Univeristy. Because of COVID-19, I am hanging up at home. 2333 

You can reach me by Zenglz_pro@163.com / lingze.pro@gmail.com
