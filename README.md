## Hi There
I'm a graduated student from Beijing Institude of Technology. 

I used to study at BIT DB Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Meihui Zhang](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/zmh/index.htm) , and do some research on knowledge graph.

(I extremely appreciate my professor's help on me.)

Tiny Ad. Prof.Zhang is a nice teacher and professor. Any talented students in Bit who are interested in database, ai, data mining, blockchain and want to do further academic investigation can contest her and join her lab. It will be a good journy for you,definitely.

I received the admission from Computer science and engineering Department in Tufts Univeristy. Because of COVID-19, I am hanging up at home. 2333
